PCP CLI app
===========

The PCP client CLI app supports sending MAP, PEER and SADSCP Opcodes (for more
information run pcp -h). Only one type of request can be sent per CLI invocation
and the type of message is determined following way:

    a./ The MAP message is sent if you provide at least
        internal port of the flow with option -i --internal.

    b./ If peer IP or port are set (using -p --peer)
        then PCP client forms and sends PCP message with PEER Opcode.

    c./ By providing jitter/loss/delay tolerances via CLI options
        the SADSCP opcode request will be created and sent.

  -e, --suggested-external
      Provide suggested external IP address and port in the PCP request.

  -t, -u, -n
      These three options are used to set the flow’s protocol type.

  -T, --timeout
      Sets the timeout, for how long should client wait on the response
      from server.

  -d, --disable-autodiscovery
      Disable auto-discovery, if this option is not present as command line
      argument, the client performs auto-discovery of the PCP server on all
      available interfaces.

  -P, --prefer-failure
      Adds the prefer failure to PCP message.

  -F, --filter
      Adds filter option to the PCP MAP message.

Examples::

  Send MAP command for TCP port 1234 bound to all internal addresses with
  lifetime set to 1 hour::

    pcp -i :1234 -l 3600

  Send MAP command for TCP port 1234 only to PCP server at 10.0.0.1:"

    pcp -d -s 10.0.0.1 -i :1234

  Send PEER for 5-tuple(source: 10.0.0.2:1234, dest 8.8.8.8:9, protocol UDP):"

    pcp -i 10.0.0.2:1234 -p 8.8.8.8:9 -u
